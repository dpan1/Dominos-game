## Rules

Dominoes is a game played with four players. The plan is to offer a one player experience with four players.

## Dominoes

There are 28 dominoes in the standard big six domino set. Dominoes have two ends, adorned with a number of pips between 
0 and 6 as seen in the reference picture. 

## Play

The first double (both values are the same) played becomes the spinner. If a spinner is not the initial play, place 
dominoes in a line from end to end. Going around the table, Dominoes are played in a cross pattern, centering on the 
spinner. From the spinner, branches are played straight outwards in the four cardinal directions, placing dominoes end 
to end. Subsequent double dominoes are played across the branch, or at a 90 degree offset. If a player does not have a 
domino whose outside end matches with an end present on the board, he is passed, colloquially known as a "knock"  

## Scoring

When a player plays a domino, a sum of the outer domino ends is taken. If the sum is greater than or equal to 10, and 
is an even multiple of 5, the player receives that value added to their score. If a double is at the end of a branch, 
it's both sides are added in scoring sum. If there is only one branch, the spinner and the other end of the branch from 
the spinner are added together.

## Deadlock

If a situation arises where it turns out nobody is able to play a domino, a deadlock has occurred. Whoever has the 
lowest total number of pips between all of the dominoes that they have left wins points for the remaining pips in all 
other players hands, rounded to the closest 5. The person who draws Big 6 gets to play first, they are not obligated to 
play Big 6.  

## Domino!

The player to play his last domino wins the round, and the count of pips in all the other players hands are added to 
the winning player, rounded to the closest 5. The person who dominoes gets to play first.

## Gameplay Variations

Nickel for knocking - if you force another player to pass for lack of playable options.
Team Play or Everyone For Themselves.
